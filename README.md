# gts-example
Using npx gts executable to quickly set up an opinionated tsconfig and linter config (eslint).
When creating a new project, just run `npx gts init` (stands for Google Typescript Style)
This will implement a few config files by Google's standards and is a nice starting point that is consistent when creating new projects
